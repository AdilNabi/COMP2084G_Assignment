<h1>COMP 2084G Assignment </h1>
<h2>By Adil Nabi 1156212</h2>

<h3>This project is for the assignment of COMP2084G of Lakehead-Georgian in which I create a digital library with rating functionality.</h3>

<p>In this assignment I created a .NET Core MVC web application using C# with integration to a SQL-Server database through Azure portal.</p>
<p>In this application the user can create genres, books and reviews for books which are all related through parent-child references.</p>
<p>Users can save a multitude of books including cover arts along with reviews in which they can leave a numerical score along with a body of text sharing their opinions on the books.</p>

<p>It works quite simple where each section of genre, book and review display a list of its respective contents. Users can go and edit current entries or view them with greater details. For example a user can view details of a review to see the review body of the rating and read the reviewers impressions of the book.</p>

<h3>NOTES:</h3>
<p>This application has as sorting functionality which was found at https://kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable/ </p>
<p>This application's image uploading code is based from class, however it is improved show images in the book detail's page as well.</p>
<p>CSS design and styles was inspired from what was taught from in-class week 5.</p>
<p>Application logo was created on https://logomakr.com/ </p>
<p>Fonts used was from https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display </p>
<p>Color scheme was designed from https://www.materialpalette.com/teal/pink </p>
